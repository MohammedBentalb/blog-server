# Notes:

- `CategoryId` is being handled as number in code and this need to be changed when publishing , since they are going to be replaced with uuids **( _change how handling then in client and server_ )**.

- `Client` is finished yet still needs some tweaking and maybe changing the manner of writing blogs.
